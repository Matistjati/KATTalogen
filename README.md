# Intermediate level

## DP
Different types of DP
Tree dp
DP optimizations
Solving lots of standard DP types

## Union find

Basic data structure
Modifications:
Smaller to larger merging
Rollback


## Square root decomposition

## Segment tree


## Directed graphs
DAGS: 
Topological sort
Longest Path

General directed graph:
Strongly connected components (Kosaraju's algorithm) 

# Advanced level

## DP
Weird DP optimizations:
Convex hull trick
Alien dp
Knuth dp
Divide and conquer dp
Convex cost function

Transitions have cycles: use djikstra

## Segment tree variants
Lazy
Sparse (dynamic/implicit)
Segment tree beats
Merge sort tree/2D segment tree
Persistent
