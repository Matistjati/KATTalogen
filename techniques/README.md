# Square-root decomposition

Often times, sqrt decomposition is looked down upon because it is rarely the optimal solution to a problem. Oftentimes, the runtimes might look as follows:

Naive: $O(N^2)$\
Intended: $O(N\cdot log(N))$\
Square root: $O(N \cdot \sqrt{N})$

Clearly, the square-root based solution is slower, which isn't as "nice" and often requires a good constant factor to pass the time limit.

However, just like any other algorithm, it is a tool that allows you to solve problems. Sometimes, sqrt-decomposition is even the best known solution to a problem.

# Dividing into blocks

Problem 1: [Range sum 2](https://golfclub.tk/contests/rangesum/problems/rangesum2).

This approach is pretty difficult to implement correctly in a short amount of time, thus leading to it not being very useful. Most problems that this approach solves can be solved using a segment tree instead. However, it can be generalized to [trees](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/46843). Another advantage is that this approach is often faster than segment trees in python.
